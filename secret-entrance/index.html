    <p><br>I wanted to make a website, one that reminded me of the greatness of the beginning of the interwebs. One which had the disgusting format, of the 90's. I belive i completed that goal, as well as making my website one that I could call my own. One that I could put all my stuff on because why the hell not?</p>
